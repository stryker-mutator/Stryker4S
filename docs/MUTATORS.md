# Supported mutators

Stryker4s supports a variety of mutators, which can be found in our [handbook](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-handbook/blob/master/mutator-types.md#supported-mutators).
Do you have a suggestion for a (new) mutator? Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker4s/issues)!

An always up-to-date reference is also available in the [MutantMatcher source](../core/src/main/scala/stryker4s/mutants/findmutants/MutantMatcher.scala).
