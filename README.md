# Stryker4s

*Professor X: For someone who hates mutants... you certainly keep some strange company.*  
*William Stryker: Oh, they serve their purpose... as long as they can be controlled.*

**Note: this project is still very much in early development and (probably) not ready to reliably be used in large projects!**

**Despite that, we'd be happy to help you out if you run into any problems or have any questions üòÅ.**

## Introduction

For an introduction to mutation testing and Stryker's features, see [stryker-mutator.io](https://stryker-mutator.io/). Looking for mutation testing in [JavaScript](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker) or [.NET](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-net)?

## Getting Started

For the quickstart, see [our website's quickstart](https://stryker-mutator.io/stryker4s/quickstart).

Stryker4s is a mutation testing framework for Scala. It allows you to test your tests by temporarily inserting bugs. Depending on your project setup, there are multiple ways to get started with Stryker4s.

## Sbt plugin

Stryker4s provides a sbt plugin for easy use within sbt projects. To install the plugin, add the following line to `plugins.sbt` [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.stryker-mutator/stryker4s-core_2.12.svg?label=Maven%20Central&colorB=brightgreen)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.stryker-mutator/sbt-stryker4s):

```scala
addSbtPlugin("io.stryker-mutator" % "sbt-stryker4s" % stryker4sVersion)
```

After adding the plugin, Stryker4s can be used by running `sbt stryker` in the root of your project.

### Memory usage

Mutation testing can be very taxing on your computer's resources. After all, your tests are run for each mutant. Sbt also has the tendency to [build up memory in a running session](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3983). It's wise to give sbt some extra memory by setting the following environment variable: `export JAVA_OPTS="-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=4G -Xmx4G $JAVA_OPTS"`. The amount of memory needed depends on the size of the project you are running Stryker4s on.

### Multi-module projects

Multi-module projects are not yet fully supported. However, there is a workaround you can use while we work on a better solution. Set the base-directory to the correct directory of the submodule with the [`base-dir` configuration setting](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#base-dir). Then you can run `sbt "project yourSubmoduleNameHere" stryker` to set the active project and run Stryker4s.

## Maven plugin

The Maven plugin can be added as follows in `pom.xml` under `<plugins>` [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.stryker-mutator/stryker4s-core_2.12.svg?label=Maven%20Central&colorB=brightgreen)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.stryker-mutator/stryker4s-maven-plugin):

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.stryker-mutator</groupId>
    <artifactId>stryker4s-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${stryker4s.version}</version>
</plugin>
```

You can then run Stryker4s with the command `mvn stryker4s:run`. Note that this is different than the command for the sbt plugin.

## Pre-release versions

We also publish SNAPSHOT versions of each commit on master. To use a pre-release, add the following setting to your `plugins.sbt`:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")
```

Then replace the Stryker4s version with this version: [![Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)](https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/https/oss.sonatype.org/io.stryker-mutator/stryker4s-core_2.12.svg)](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/stryker-mutator/).

## Configuration

See [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for setting up your `stryker4s.conf` file (optional).

## Supported mutators

Stryker4s supports a variety of mutators, which can be found in our [handbook](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-handbook/blob/master/mutator-types.md#supported-mutators).
Do you have a suggestion for a (new) mutator? Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker4s/issues/new)!

An always up-to-date reference is also available in the [MutantMatcher source](core/src/main/scala/stryker4s/mutants/findmutants/MutantMatcher.scala).
